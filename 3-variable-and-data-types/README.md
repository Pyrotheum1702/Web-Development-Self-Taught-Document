# Python Variable
  1. Lesson content:
  - Python Variable
  - Variable assignment
  2. What i learned:
  - What is a variable in Python
    - A variable is a pointer reference to an object
  - How to assign a variable
  - How variable work in python
    - In Python variable is actually a pointer reference to an object. When you declare a variable, the interpreter will look for an object have the value of the assignment if it's exist, variable will point to it, else it will create a new object then have the variable point to it
    - If there is no any variable point to a certain object, that object is considered an orphaned, and it will be automatically deleted by garbage collector
  - Variable could be re-assign with different type of data
  - How to chain assign multiple variable simultaneously
  - Python variable is dynamically typed
  # Data Type
  1. Lesson content:
  - Integer
  - Floating-Point number
  - Strings
  1. What i learned:
  - Integer is a whole number, without decimals and are of unlimited length
  - Float is a value with decimals, Float values in Python are represented as 64-bit double-precision values
  - String is a sequences of character data
  - A String can contain unlimited number of character
  - Integer and Float can be either positive or negative
  - In Python there is no limit to how long an integer value can be
