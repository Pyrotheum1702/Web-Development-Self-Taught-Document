# Python Programming Paradigms
1. Lesson Content:
  - Python Programming Paradigm
  - Object Oriented Programming Paradigm
  - Functional Programming Paradigm
  - Procedural Programming Paradigm
2. What i learned:
  - What is programming paradigm:
    - A programming paradigm is an approach, methods, model or a way to solve the problem or write a program.
  - Python supports three types of Programming paradigms:
    - Object Oriented programming paradigms
    - Procedure Oriented programming paradigms
    - Functional programming paradigms
  - Object-Oriented Programming:
    - In the object-oriented programming paradigm, objects are the key element of the paradigm. Objects can simply be defined as the instance of a class that contains both data members and the method functions.
    - OOP most important concept:
      - Inheritance
      - Polymorphism
      - Encapsulation
      - Abstraction
  - Procedural Programming:
    - Procedural programming mean to program in series of computational steps, the execution instructions that happen in step by step to reach a goal or to complete a certain task.
    - Procedural programming paradigm focuses on the process rather than data.
    - Procedural programming is best for simple programs but is better is use other programming paradigms for solving complex programs.
  - Functional programming:
    - Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which use functions as the main building blocks of the program.
    - The most importance concept in functional programming is the concept of pure function.
      - Mean the output of the function should only depend on it's input or arguments.
