  1. Lesson content:
  - What is type casting
  - Implicit Type Casting
  - Explicit Type Casting
  2. What i learned:
  - Type casting is a method to convert value of a data type to another data type
  - Implicit type casting is type casting automatically perform by Python
    - Example : if you perform a calculation with an integer to a float the result would be a float value
  - Python can not perform a addition with a string to an int or a float automatically so you need to use explicit Type Casting method to do it
  - Mainly in explicit type casting can be done with these data type function:
    - `int()` function take float or string as an argument and return int type object
    - `str()` function take float or int as an argument and return string type object
    - `float()`function take int or string as an argument and return float type object
