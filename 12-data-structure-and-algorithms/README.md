1. What i learned:
- An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- List and Array are similar. However user can not constraint the type of elements stored in a list.
- Array can be handled in Python by a module named `array`. They can be useful when we have to manipulate only a specific data type values.
  - `array` module:
    - The data type is specified at the array creation time by using a single character is called the type code.
    - `array(i, [x])`: where `i` is type code, `[x]` is the value list.
    - Elements of an array can only have a specific type specified by the type code.
