  - Array
  - Array in Python
6. What i learned:
- An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- List and Array are similar. However user can not constraint the type of elements stored in a list.
- Array can be handled in Python by a module named `array`. They can be useful when we have to manipulate only a specific data type values.
  - `array` module:
    - The data type is specified at the array creation time by using a single character is called the type code.
    - `array(i, [x])`: where `i` is type code, `[x]` is the value list.
    - Elements of an array can only have a specific type specified by the type code.
# Linked List
1. Lesson Content:
  - Linked List
2. What i learned:
  - Linked List is a linear collection of items, where each item point to the next item in the list. Item in linked list are called *node* where each node have 2 part, a part that hold the value and a pointer to the next node, linking each node to the other.
  - Linked List also have 2 item are the *head* and the *tail* where the head point to the first node and the tail point to the last node.
# Stack
1. Lesson content:
  - Stack
2. What i learned:
  - Stack is a linear collection of items, where items are inserted and remove in a specific order
  - Retrieval an item from the stack follow the LIFO principle(last in first out), where the item to be retrieve will always be the last item that was added to the stack.
  - In Python, we could use `list` to mimic a stack.
